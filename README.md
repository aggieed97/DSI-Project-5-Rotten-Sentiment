## Introduction
For Project Five in my Data Science Immersive course, I chose to take on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews) competition for sentiment analysis of movie reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

Rotten Tomatoes has become one of the go-to places to help determine if a movie is any good based on reviews from professional critics.  RT uses the Tomatometer which represents the percentage of professional critic reviews that are positive for a given film.

#### Tomatometer
- When at least 60% of reviews are positive, a red tomato is displayed to indicate its “Fresh” status.
- Anything less than 60% and a green “splat” is displayed indicating its “Rotten” status.
- Certified Fresh goes to movies/TV that meet certain strict requirements.
-		A steady Tomatometer score of 75% or higher.
- 		At least five reviews from Top Critics.
- 		Films in wide release must have a minimum of 80 reviews.
- 		Films in limited release must have a minimum of 40 reviews.
- 		Only individual seasons of a TV show are eligible, and each must have a minimum of 20 reviews.

####Audience Score
- Full popcorn bucket - 3.5 stars or higher
- Tipped over popcorn buck - Less than 3.5 starts
- Plus sign for movies that do not have audience ratings

## Dataset

The datasets were available on Kaggle and were provided by the [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com).  There is a Train set as well as a Test set.  The data is comprised of phrases and sentiment ID's (positive, slightly positive, neutral, slightly negative, or negative).
